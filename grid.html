            Life is probably the best gift from God. It teaches us so many
            things. Life is full of ups and downs. But we must never forget that
            whatever happens, it happens for good only. Life has taught me so
            many things. To be honest it was probably the best teacher ever. We
            make mistakes but we learn from them. Life also gifted us so many
            things. It gave us friends, family, traditions, cultures and so many
            festivals. There are certain people who think of dying every single
            moment. But they are forgetting this fact that we just have one
            single life and we should thus enjoy it to the fullest. Often people
            say that friends are our lives. This infact is true. Some people get
            so much close with their friends that they truely understand the
            actual meaning of happiness. It is better to have one true friend
            than millions of false friends. I have so many friends and brainly
            along with knowledge has gifted me several good friends. The list
            never ends and I hope never it will. The world is full of bad
            people. Still among them we need to find the one who loves us, who
            care for us and who will always be there for us. We need to move on,
            no matter whatever happens. Besides friendship, life is also full of
            betrayals. But when you get betrayed and we should thus enjoy it to
            the fullest. Often people say that friends are our lives. This
            infact is true. Some people get so much close with their friends
